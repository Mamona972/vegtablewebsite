# Vegtable Website 

A full-stack vegetable e-commerce website built using modern web technologies.  
This project showcases my skills in **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **JWT authentication**, **cookie management**, **bcrypt**, **Axios**, and more.  

I learned a lot from various tutorials and online resources, which guided me in creating a fully functional website. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end development, understanding how to handle data, authentication, and user interactions in a professional environment.
